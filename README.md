Thermodial is a combination temperature sensor reader and dial display for
use on a Raspberry Pi equipped with a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor.

The thermodial program is an extension of a text-based temperature sensor
tutorial provided online by Adafruit: [Click here to go to the tutorial.](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing)

The thermodial program adds a Viewidget dial to the original thermometer
program in order to create an aesthetically pleasing temperature display.
The code is intended to be simple in order to provide an example on how
easy it is to add a graphical display to any text-based scientific program.
